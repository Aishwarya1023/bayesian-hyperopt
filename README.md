Bayesian Optimization with Hyperopt
====================================

This repo contains a module of code for implementation of bayesian optimization for PySpark models using HyperOpt.

The full implementation can be viewed at a glance in `example_implementation.html`

#Usage
1. Set up PySpark on your machine
2. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
3. Run test.py

#Modifying Code for reuse

You can add/change the `model_type` arguments to accomodate your specific model.
